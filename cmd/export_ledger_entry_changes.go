The information is exported in batches determined by the batch-size flag. Each exported file will include the changes to the 
relevent data type that occurred during that batch.

If the end-ledger is omitted, then the stellar-core node will continue running and exporting information as new ledgers are 
confirmed by the Stellar network.

be exported.`,

				b) If the end is omitted, use an unbounded range and continue exporting as new ledgers are added to the network
			2. Call GetLedger() constantly in a separate goroutine
				a) Create channels for each data type
				b) Process changes for the ledger and send changes to the channel matching their type
			3. On the other end, receive changes from the channel
				a) Call transform on individual changes
				b) Once batch_size ledgers have been sent, encode and export the changes
